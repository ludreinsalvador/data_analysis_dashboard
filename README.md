# global-covid-19_data_analysis_dashboards
This repository showcases a collection of my projects that involve extracting datasets from open sources, followed by data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to derive meaningful analysis and insights.

## About the Project
This project aims to create an interactive dashboard using PowerBI to visualize and analyze global COVID-19 data sourced from the WHO. The dashboard will provide insights into the spread, impact, and vaccination progress of COVID-19 across different regions.

## Objectives/Problems
- To provide a clear visual representation of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination rates globally.
- To identify trends and patterns in the data that can inform public health decisions.
- To offer an interactive tool for users to explore COVID-19 data at various granularities (e.g., by country, region, and over time).
