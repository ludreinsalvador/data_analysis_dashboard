# The-Global-Covid-19_Cases-Deaths-and-Vaccination-Trends

## About the Project
This project focuses on creating an interactive PowerBI dashboards to visualize and analyze global COVID-19 data sourced from the World Health Organization (WHO). The dashboards offers insights into the spread, impact, and vaccination progress of COVID-19 across various regions.

## Objectives/Problems
- To provide a clear visual representation of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination rates globally.
- To identify trends and patterns in the data that can inform public health decisions.
- To offer an interactive tool for users to explore COVID-19 data at various granularities (e.g., by country, region, and over time).

## Dataset Used
The dataset, sourced from the World Health Organization (WHO), provides authoritative global data on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations. It is crucial for analyzing the pandemic's impact and monitoring vaccination progress worldwide.
- <a href="https://github.com/ludreinsalvador/global-covid-19_data_analysis_dashboards/blob/main/WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv">WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv</a> - Contains daily reports on COVID-19 cases and deaths for various countries and regions.
- <a href="https://github.com/ludreinsalvador/global-covid-19_data_analysis_dashboards/blob/main/vaccination-data.csv">vaccination-data.csv</a> - Contains data on COVID-19 vaccinations, including the number of doses administered and the number of people vaccinated by country.
  
## Questions (KPIs)
- How have COVID-19 cases and deaths evolved globally over time?
- Which countries or regions have the highest number of cases and deaths?
- What are the trends in vaccination rates across different countries?
- How does the number of cases correlate with vaccination rates?
- Are there any noticeable patterns in the data that suggest successful or unsuccessful public health strategies?
